# Hey there! I'm Yogesh Kuchimanchi 

🚀 Welcome to my corner of the AI multiverse!  
I'm a passionate **Data Scientist + Full Stack Explorer** building *intelligent, impactful, and imaginative* tools using AI, ML, and NLP. Whether it's emotional art generation or fixing messy data, I make ideas come alive through code.

## 🔍 Not Just Flashy — They're Functional

I don’t just make cool projects — I **ship** tools that:
- Clean real-world data messes
- Decode human emotion using ML
- Make AI explain itself
- Work in real-time dashboards
- Use modern stacks: `Python`, `TypeScript`, `FastAPI`, `Next.js`, `Ollama`, `PyTorch`, `Streamlit`, and `LLMs`.

## 💼 Actively Seeking Opportunities

I'm currently looking for:
- Data Science Internships (Remote or US-based)
- AI Research Assistantships
- LLM x Product Integration Roles

**I’m open to anything that challenges me to grow.**  
You’ll get passion, fast learning, and a builder’s mindset.
